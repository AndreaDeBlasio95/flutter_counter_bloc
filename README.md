# Flutter Counter using BLoC Design Pattern

Welcome to the Flutter Counter project using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) design pattern! This project is an implementation of the counter app using the BLoC architecture as described in the official [BLoC documentation](https://bloclibrary.dev/tutorials/flutter-counter/).

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the implementation of a simple counter application using the BLoC design pattern in Flutter. The BLoC pattern helps to separate business logic from the UI, making the code more maintainable and testable.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: [Install Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Dart SDK: Comes bundled with Flutter
- An IDE of your choice (VS Code, Android Studio, IntelliJ, etc.)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/flutter-counter-bloc.git
   cd flutter-counter-bloc
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Running the Project

1. **Run the app:**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

2. **Build the app:**

   ```bash
   flutter build apk
   ```

## Usage

Once you run the app, you can increment and decrement the counter using the provided buttons. The app state is managed by the BLoC, ensuring a clear separation between the UI and business logic.

## Documentation

For a detailed explanation of the code structure and implementation, refer to the official [BLoC documentation](https://bloclibrary.dev/tutorials/flutter-counter/).
